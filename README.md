# Web-Server
This is a simple web server in C/C++ using TCP sockets. My server is able to handle connections from multiple clients (maximum of 10) using port number 30000 as the listening port, accept and parse HTTP requests, retrieve files from the serverâ€™s file system, and build and send HTTP response messages.
